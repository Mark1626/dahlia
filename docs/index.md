title: Notes About Seashell
---
Read some notes about aspects of Seashell's design:

* [Index types.](indextype.html)
  This is the Seashell type system's main mechanism for enforcing safe access to banked memories from unrolled loops (i.e., parallelized hardware).

* [Multidimensional arrays.](multidimensional.html)
  Seashell supports *logical access* to multidimensional arrays implemented as banked hardware memories. We discuss the relationship between this logical view and the physical layout in banks.
